## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Kazi_MADE - Climate Confluence: Analyzing the Impact of CO2 Emissions on Global Temperature Trends

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do CO2 emissions correlate with global temperature trends?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
By analyzing past data on CO2 levels and temperatures, we want to see if higher CO2 emissions cause higher global temperatures. Usually, we expect that more CO2 in the atmosphere leads to warmer temperatures. Understanding this relationship helps us see how this affects the climate. The results can guide actions to reduce CO2 emissions and slow down global warming.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### DataSource1: CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
* Metadata URL: https://github.com/owid/co2-data/tree/master
* Data URL: https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains data on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics.

### DataSource2: Earth Surface Temperature Data
